h. Manager id

a. Tblgroup table under the current db will map to UserDepartments

b. Roles table from current db will map to userroles table

c. A listing of departments from the current prd table will be added to the

userdepartments .

d. When user data is migrated the userid that will go with a dept id will be done against a

mapping of department ids from both databases.

i. For ex department operations under current db is 21 but under new DB it may

be 2. For all users that belong to deptid 21 under current db will now have dept

id 2 in the new db.

4. Open questions

e. Roles mapping will be done in a similar fashion.

a. There is no separate rep table required

b. What will happen if a user leaves the company and is marked inactive. He should not

appear in the listing of users.

c. All accounts and sales activity that belong to that user must be marked inactive and

hence will not appear in the summary sections of accounts/leads/tasks/sales activity.

d. Role hierarchy must be maintained and hence a manager id field also must be added to

the users table.

e. Role hierarchy determines automatically controls data visibility.

f. Created on, Created by, updated on, updated by must be there in all tables in the DB.

Current db is missing these fields in many tables and has posed us many problems. As a

rule add these columns to all tables.
